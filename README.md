Peace be upon you, Cycle 45 heroes 🤩
This is our fourth assignment: Fokir 💼
🔗 Link: https://routeegy.github.io/Fokir/

Requirements:
🔴 We’ll build the website exactly like this one.
🔴 The animation in the first section is optional, but completing it gives you bonus points 💯.
🔴 The Portfolio section should be created as a static layout only. That means it’s not required to make the cards change when clicking on “graphic” or other filters.
🔴 The Feedback section should also be created as a static design. You don’t need to build the functionality to flip between 2 cards—just create one card.

Some hints to help you ✨
1️⃣ The first section has a transparent black overlay on the image—don’t forget to add it.
2️⃣ Search how to add an icon from Font Awesome.
3️⃣ There’s a nice CSS property called resize, which can be used with <textarea>. Do a quick search about it.

Good luck, in shaa’ Allah ❤
Deadline: Friday, 4/4 at 10 PM
